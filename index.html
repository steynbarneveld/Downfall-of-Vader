        <h2>Short Introdcution
        </h2>
        <p>On this webpage I made for practice I will quickly be going through the reasons 
            Darth Vader went from being one of cinema's greatest villains to a soulless and boring one. 
            In my opinion his drastic change can mostly be explained by two things: writing and (a lack of) voice acting. 
        I will be going over both these point individually in a bit more detail.

        <h2>Writing
        </h2>
        <p>The first of the two reasons seems to be because of something that is quite akin to a lost artform in modern Hollywood. 
        Full of inconsistencies, plot holes, virtue signalling and a complete lack of logic, it seems that bad writing has claimed  
        another victim yet again.Unfortunately for many Star Wars fans this time this victim is Darth Vader. 
        In the new Star Wars show: 'Kenbobi' he is portrayed completely out of character, here are a few examples: <br>
        he forgives and gives second chances to people who are clearly incompetent, he is incapable of thinking of solutions anyone 
        could come up with, sometimes he is capable of things but then isn't ten seconds later. <br> Most of all he is being treated 
        as if he's not that big of a deal while he is known as the most dangerous man in the galaxy. To quickly summarize he went 
        from a cunning, ruthless & intimidating villain to an incomptent tall man in a black suit with a red light stick.

        <h2>Voice 'acting'
        </h2>
        <p>The second and also last reason I will be mentioning in this project where I'm writing text for just to fill up a page 
        is the voice acting, or in this case; the lack thereof. With the original voice actor of Darth Vader, James Earl Jones being at 
        quite an advanced age disney opted to use a program called <a href="https://www.respeecher.com/" target="_blank" title="Respeecher Website">Respeecher</a>. 
        Although the voice of Vader certainly sounds like 
        James Earl Jones there is something quite uncanny about it, the voice is void of emotion and monotone. All of the anger and spite 
        that was heard from Vader in the original trilogy is missing and it makes him sound robotic and boring. It seems that once again 
        Disney's endless greed has ruined yet another fan favourite character. Some things might be better left to rest. <br> <br>
