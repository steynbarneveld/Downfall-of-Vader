        <h2>Short Introdcution
        </h2>
        <p>On this webpage I made for practice I will quickly be going through the reasons 
            Darth Vader <br> went from being one of cinema's greatest villains to a soulless and boring one. <br>
            In my opinion his drastic change can mostly be explained by two things: writing and (a lack of) voice acting. <br>
        I will be going over both these point individually in a bit more detail.

        <h2>Writing
        </h2>
        <p>The first of the two reasons seems to be because of something that is quite akin to a lost artform in modern Hollywood. <br>
        Full of inconsistencies, plot holes, virtue signalling and a complete lack of logic, it seems that bad writing has claimed <br> 
        another victim yet again.Unfortunately for many Star Wars fans this time this victim is Darth Vader. <br>
        In the new Star Wars show: 'Kenbobi' he is portrayed completely out of character, here are a few examples: <br>
        he forgives and gives second chances to people who are clearly incompetent, he is incapable of thinking of solutions anyone <br>
        could come up with, sometimes he is capable of things but then isn't ten seconds later. Most of all he is being treated <br>
        as if he's not that big of a deal while he is known as the most dangerous man in the galaxy. To quickly summarize he went <br>
        from a cunning, ruthless & intimidating villain to an incomptent tall man in a black suit with a red light stick.

        <h2>Voice 'acting'
        </h2>
        <p>The second and also last reason I will be mentioning in this project where I'm writing text for just to fill up a page <br>
        is the voice acting, or in this case; the lack thereof. With the original voice actor of Darth Vader, James Earl Jones being at <br>
        quite an advanced age disney opted to use a program called <a href="https://www.respeecher.com/" target="_blank" tile="Respeecher Website">Respeecher</a>. 
        Although the voice of Vader certainly sounds like <br>
        James Earl Jones there is something quite uncanny about it, the voice is void of emotion and monotone. All of the anger and spite <br>
        that was heard from Vader in the original trilogy is missing and it makes him sound robotic and boring. It seems that once again <br>
        Disney's endless greed has ruined yet another fan favourite character. Some things might be better left to rest.
